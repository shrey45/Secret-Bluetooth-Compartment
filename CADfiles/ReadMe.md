# Please read this for some info about the files!
**Henry update this please**

Update **2.13.21**: Enough subtle changes have been made (darn optimizing design!!!) that all the files in the directory are being deleted and re-uploaded. Don't worry, it's all in the cloud.

Update **3.23.21**: Delete and re-up again. Design has been made better suited to 3D printing, and is on it's way to having connectors modeled.

Update **4.27.21** Back again! The snap-fit connectors of the are hopefully at their final stage, and everything else should be soon to follow.

Update **6.8.21** Last week of the 2021 school year. Reuploading all final CAD files, including a small template for **snap fits**.

Update **6.11.21** Added images and descriptions!

# Images & descriptions

<img src="https://github.com/shrey45/Secret-Bluetooth-Compartment/blob/main/CADfiles/Images/AssembledParts/TransluscentFullAssembly.png?raw=true" height=500>
This image is of the full assembly, but translucent to show you all the interior parts and aspects. The bottom wall with its pieces, the opening mechanism, and the semi-hidden magnets are all visible.

This image shows a solid external portion of the opening mechanism, including the solenoid holding mechanism. You can slightly glimpse the pin housing on the cone, and also you can see the hinge holding the cone to the top wall.

This is a perspective of the bottom wall, revealing the Arduino Nano and the battery holder. Just another point!
