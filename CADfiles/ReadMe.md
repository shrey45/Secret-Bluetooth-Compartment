# Please read this for some info about the files!
**Henry update this please**

Update **2.13.21**: Enough subtle changes have been made (darn optimizing design!!!) that all the files in the directory are being deleted and re-uploaded. Don't worry, it's all in the cloud.

Update **3.23.21**: Delete and re-up again. Design has been made better suited to 3D printing, and is on it's way to having connectors modeled.

Update **4.27.21** Back again! The snap-fit connectors of the are hopefully at their final stage, and everything else should be soon to follow.

Update **6.8.21** Last week of the 2021 school year. Reuploading all final CAD files, including a small template for **snap fits**.

Update **6.11.21** Added images and descriptions!
